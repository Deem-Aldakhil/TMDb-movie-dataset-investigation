# TMDb-movie-dataset-investigation
In this project, I am going to take TMDb movie dataset and investigate it. This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue. Which makes it a great data to explorer and investigate and create some knowledge about movies trend out of it. Since the data includes movies from more than 50 years ago, the first question I am going to make is:      Which year has the most number of successful movies?  And to make an analysis about the movies released in each year, I am going to ask:      How many movies released for each year?  So let's go and see the answers of these questions!
